    <h3>🔥 Daily Devotion</h3>
    <p>Every single day, Natnat gave me a glimpse of her light, her laugh, her *curls*, and just enough cleavage to keep my blood pressure unstable.</p>
    <p>That’s not just love. That’s commitment with spice. 🌶️</p>

    <h3>🦋 To My Sunflower Queen</h3>
    <p>You with the curly hair, the gentle soul, the red-stained lips, and that butterfly laugh—
    you’ve crocheted yourself into every part of me.
    Your voice calms me. Your boobs distract me. And your love anchors me.</p>
    <p>From your Jibi: the tall, silent, clingy dentist-businessman who lives for every Duduy Day with you.</p>
